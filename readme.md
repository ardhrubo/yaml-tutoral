# Basic YAML File

This repository contains a basic YAML file demonstrating key-value pairs and various YAML features. Indentation is crucial in YAML files, and this example highlights several important aspects.

## File Structure

### Key-Value Pairs

The YAML file contains a `courses` section with various key-value pairs:

```yaml
courses:
    product_name: "Laptop"
    version: 1.0
    price: &price 100
    color: "Black"
    brand: "Dell"
    in_stock: true
    release_date: 2021-01-01
    sold_units: null
    warranty:
        warranty_years: 2
        warranty_type: "Manufacturer"
    features:
        - core i5 processor
        - 8GB RAM
        - 1TB SSD
        - 15.6 inch display
    tags: [laptop, dell, core i5, 8GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 15.6 inch display]
    reviews:
        - name: "AR Dhrubo"
            rating: 5
            comment: "Good product"
        - name: "Fariduzzaman Ifty"
            rating: 4
            comment: "Nice product"
        - {name: "Abdur Rahman", rating: 3, comment: "Average product"}
    short_description: >
        This is a laptop with core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 15.6 inch display.
        It is a good product for daily use.
    long_description: |
        This is a laptop with core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 15.6 inch display.
            It is a good product for daily use.
        It has a warranty of 2 years.
    payment: *price
```

### Advanced Features

The file also demonstrates advanced YAML features such as references and merging dictionaries:

```yaml

more: &more
  mykey: myvalue

much_more:
  one: three
  << : *more
```

## Key Points

- **Indentation**: Indentation is critical in YAML files.
- **References**: Use `&` to create a reference and `*` to use it.
- **Merging Dictionaries**: Use `<<` to merge dictionaries.

## Usage

This YAML file can be used as a template or reference for creating structured data in YAML format. It is particularly useful for configuration files, data serialization, and more.

For more information on YAML syntax and features, refer to the [YAML official documentation](https://yaml.org/).
